# nvim-fredrik

My custom Neovim configuration, based on [kickstart-modular.nvim](https://github.com/dam9000/kickstart-modular.nvim).

As I'm slowly migrating over from LazyVim to my own configuration, the folder structure will closely match the one of kickstart-modular.nvim.

## Notes

After syncing up with the remote fork, make sure to uncomment the `require` statements in `lazy-plugins.lua`, so to load the custom config.
