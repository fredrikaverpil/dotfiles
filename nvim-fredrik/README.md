## Try it out! ðŸš€

```bash
# clone it down into your ~/.config folder
git clone git@github.com:fredrikaverpil/dotfiles ~/.config/fredrikaverpil/dotfiles

# run nvim with NVIM_APPNAME
NVIM_APPNAME=fredrikaverpil/dotfiles/nvim-fredrik nvim
```

## Design choices

I wanted to take a modular approach to my Neovim setup. This was made possible
thanks to the quite amazing [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
plugin manager.

### Main initialization

In [lua/fredrik/init.lua](lua/fredrik/init.lua), the entire config is loaded in
sequence. First general options and general autocommands are set up. Finally,
the lazy.nvim plugin manager is invoked for loading of all plugins.

- [lua/fredrik/config/options.lua](lua/fredrik/config/options.lua)
- [lua/fredrik/config/autocmds.lua](lua/fredrik/config/autocmds.lua)
- [lua/fredrik/config/lazy.lua](lua/fredrik/config/lazy.lua)

I've specified the lazy.nvim `spec` (order of loading plugins) accordingly:

1. Any plugin's config from the `plugins` folder.
2. Plugin configs for a specific language from the `plugins/lang` folder.
3. Plugin configs for "core" from the `plugins/core` folder.
4. (Plugin configs from local `.lazy.lua`).

Below, I'll go through the characteristics of these levels of loading plugin
configs.

### Generic plugins

Plugins that are not associated with a certain language or needs complex setup
are considered just to be a plain "plugin". They are defined in the `plugins`
folder root.

### Per-language plugin configs

For a complete and nice experience when working in a certain language,
per-language configurations are placed in `plugins/lang`.

Formatting, linting and LSP configs are specified in the per-language plugin
configs. This provides a complete picture of what is supported by browsing a
language config file.

### Core plugin configs

A "core" plugin config is just a term I coined, and represents a plugin which
defines a lazy.nvim `config` for the given plugin, and takes in multiple merged
`opts` defined in several other lua files (such as the per-language configs).

This enables the ability to specify e.g. LSP configs in multiple files, which
are then assembled and loaded in the "core" LSP plugin config.

The end goal is to modularize the entire setup, using these "core" plugin
configs.

### Per-project overrides ("local spec") via local `.lazy.lua`

Lazy.nvim comes with the capability of reading a local, per-project, `.lazy.lua`
file, which serves as a way to make changes and overrides, based on project
needs. The contents of the `.lazy.lua` will be loaded at the end of the
lazy.nvim spec and requires the lazy.nvim option `local_spec = true`.

Concrete example below, where conform.nvim is overidden to pass certain
arguments to the `gci` formatter:

```lua
-- .lazy.lua

return {

  {
    "stevearc/conform.nvim",
    -- https://github.com/stevearc/conform.nvim
    enabled = true,
    opts = function(_, opts)
      local formatters = require("conform.formatters")

      vim.api.nvim_echo({ { "Using custom import ordering", "None" } }, false, {})
      -- https://github.com/stevearc/conform.nvim/blob/master/lua/conform/formatters/gci.lua
      formatters.gci.args = {
        "write",
        "-s",
        "standard",
        "-s",
        "default",
        "-s",
        "Prefix(github.com/shipwallet)",
        "--skip-generated",
        "--skip-vendor",
        "$FILENAME",
      }
    end,
  },
}
```
