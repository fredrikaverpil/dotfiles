# kaizen

`kaizen` is [niri](https://niri-wm.github.io/niri/) plus a
[Quickshell](https://quickshell.org) shell: a minimal, keyboard-first desktop
that an agent can drive and verify from a terminal.

## Intent

- NixOS is the base. systemd, D-Bus, logind, PipeWire, NetworkManager, BlueZ,
  UPower, PAM, polkit and the portals do their jobs untouched; the shell reads
  and drives their state, never owns a copy of it.
- Build only what is used. A panel exists only where a subsystem has no
  keyboard-first face; infrequent tasks go to a purpose-built application
  (bluetui, nm-connection-editor).
- Keyboard-first everywhere. Pointer-only controls are bugs.
- Every action is reachable over `qs ipc`, `niri msg` or `systemctl --user`.
- Host-agnostic naming: "kaizen" in units, PAM, layer namespaces and state
  files. No hostname in the desktop's configuration.

## Layers

```mermaid
flowchart BT
  subgraph HW[Hardware / kernel]
    sysfs[sysfs: backlight, hwmon, battery thresholds]
    keyd[keyd: key remaps]
    drv[xe, iwlwifi]
  end
  subgraph SYS[NixOS system services and D-Bus]
    logind[logind: lid, power key, sleep, SetBrightness]
    pw[PipeWire / WirePlumber]
    nm[NetworkManager]
    bluez[BlueZ]
    upower[UPower / power-profiles-daemon]
    keyring[gnome-keyring: Secret Service]
    polkitd[polkit]
    portal[xdg-desktop-portal-gnome / gtk]
  end
  subgraph WM[Compositor]
    niri["niri --session under UWSM: layer-shell, session-lock, screencopy, idle-notify, niri msg"]
  end
  subgraph SHELL[kaizen: Quickshell]
    svc[modules/services: daemon and process state]
    ui[surfaces: bar, launcher, panels, context menus, notifications, lock, polkit agent, background]
    svc --> ui
  end
  HW --> SYS --> WM --> SHELL
```

Each layer calls downward only. Nix (`session.nix`, `thinkpad.nix`) owns the
two lower layers and the systemd units; Stow (`stow/kaizen/`) owns compositor
config and QML. Both are shared by every kaizen host.

## Time and place

- The timezone lives in [timedated] (`/etc/localtime`). The timezone service
  runs `timedatectl set-timezone` with an id from `ZonesModel.js` and reads the
  result back; polkit may prompt. ThinkPads leave `time.timeZone` unset so the
  choice survives rebuilds; stationary hosts pin it.
- Zones are IANA ids. tzdata evaluates DST per instant; the Clock panel shows
  offset, abbreviation, UTC and the next DST change, the last from `zdump`.
- Zone-aware formatting goes through `date(1)`. Qt's JS engine has no `Intl`
  and ignores `toLocaleString`'s `timeZone` option.
- The weather location is a coordinate picked from `PlacesModel.js` and saved
  by the shell; the machines have no GNSS. Nightlight takes sunrise and sunset
  from the same coordinate, so one saved place moves both.
- After a zone change, restart `quickshell.service` by hand, and any other
  long-running process that shows local time, such as the calendar plugin's
  `dcal.service`: glibc caches the parsed tzfile, so a running process keeps
  the zone it started with. The restart stays manual because the shell must
  never restart while locked. Removing `/etc/localtime` is not a test; that
  falls back to UTC, which only looks like a live pickup.

## Surfaces

```
Launcher (modules/menu)            keyboard entry point; drills down levels
  ├─ Apps, Keybindings, Emoji     providers
  ├─ Trigger                      screenshots, recording, clipboard, window actions
  ├─ Settings                     per bar button: its panel, then its actions; Session
  ├─ Tray                         tray menus, cascaded per level
  └─ Plugins                      one node per plugin
Panel (Ui/Panel)                   centered card; h/l step focus
Context menu (Ui/ContextMenu)      hangs from the bar button that opened it
Bar (modules/bar)                  one PanelWindow per output
Notifications, Lock, Polkit, Background, Curtain   own layer surfaces
```

- Launcher, panel and context menu hold exclusive keyboard focus and close
  each other through `shell.claimPanel`. Pick by what opens the surface.
- Every surface opens over IPC; niri binds are `spawn qs ipc call ...`.
- The bar mirrors the launcher; nothing is reachable only from it. Every
  panel action is a launcher row under Settings, except sliders and per-item
  detail (forgetting a network, recording options).
- Bar buttons come in four kinds, told apart by what a click does:
  - ❄ and the workspaces: left-click opens the launcher, right-click its top
    level as a context menu; a workspace takes focus.
  - Panel buttons: left-click opens the panel, right-click the button's
    Settings node as a context menu. The date is one only when a plugin takes
    it over, and opens the plugin's node; otherwise it is a plain label.
  - Indicators, shown only off the default state: left-click acts on it
    (stops the recording, re-enables idle locking, resets the layout, opens
    the system monitor).
  - Tray items: the app's own activation and menu.
- A plugin (`Ui/Plugin.qml`) adds launcher items, its own panels and IPC
  targets, and may take over the date button (`barActions.date`):
  left-click calls the plugin, right-click opens its `plugins.<name>` node.
  `plugins/hello/` is the minimal example.
- A plugin that needs a long-running backend brings its own daemon: its module
  adds the unit, and its QML queries the daemon's IPC. The calendar
  (`plugins/calendar/`) does this with [dcal].
- A tray plugin is an app written for kaizen, with its own
  [StatusNotifierItem] and menu (`plugins/hello-tray/`), so the tray and its
  launcher level show it without shell code. Its unit starts it with the
  session or from Apps. A third-party app with a tray icon is not a plugin;
  the tray shows it anyway.
- `Ui/Compositor.qml` is the only path to niri.

## Session lifecycle

```
TTY login ─ kaizen() ─ uwsm start niri --session
  └─ wayland-session@niri.target
       ├─ quickshell.service        Restart=on-failure
       └─ kaizen-sleep-lock.service logind delay inhibitor
lid close / power key ─ logind ─ sleep-lock locks shell ─ waits for secure ─ suspend
```

Units bind to `wayland-session@niri.target`; ordering after
`graphical-session.target` is a cycle. `wayland-session-waitenv.service`
closes niri's readiness-before-`WAYLAND_DISPLAY` race.

## Where the shell writes

| Kind | Path | Lifetime |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Regenerable cache | `~/.cache/kaizen-shell/` | until deleted |
| State that must survive | `~/.local/state/kaizen-shell/` | across reboots |
| Lock and socket state | `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/kaizen-<name>` | until logout |

- These three roots only. `~/.config/quickshell/` is Stow's tree.
- Files are flat in the root, one value or small JSON document each. The
  unit's `StateDirectory=` creates the state root.
- Many or unbounded entries get a subdirectory
  (`kaizen-shell/wallpaper-thumbs/`); a single file is written directly
  (`kaizen-shell/weather-<lat>_<lon>.json`). Moving from one file to one per
  input needs a sweep first.
- Every cache producer prunes its own entries, since nothing prunes `~/.cache`
  on these hosts: touch an entry on use (a hit or a 304 counts) and delete
  entries older than 30 days in the same pass. A producer that cannot age
  entries this way says in a comment what bounds it.

## Out of scope

- Bluetooth pairing, connection editing: bluetui, nm-connection-editor.
- Output layout: hand-kept in `stow/host/<host>/.config/niri/outputs.kdl`,
  keyed by monitor, not port.
- Compositor-side XKB toggling: the shell owns layout state.
- Clipboard persistence: memory only, skips password-manager offers.
- Portal-based recording: gpu-screen-recorder talks to PipeWire directly.
- `GNOME` in `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP`: breaks `NotShowIn=GNOME` autostarts.
  Electron apps get `--password-store=gnome-libsecret` instead.
- Fingerprint unlock: would block typing in the single PAM stack.

## Adding something

1. Does a subsystem already do it? Read its state; do not duplicate it.
2. Does a purpose-built app do it acceptably? Launch that instead.
3. Can it be used with the keyboard only? If not, redesign.
4. Then: daemon/process state → `modules/services/`, view →
   `modules/panels/`; a protocol-driven surface with no other consumer of its
   state (lock, notifications, polkit) keeps both in `modules/<name>/`.
   Packages/units/PAM → `session.nix`, compositor → `Ui/compositors/` and
   `niri/config.kdl`, IPC target for every new action. A shell extension only
   some hosts want is a plugin (`host.kaizenPlugins`). An app is not kaizen's
   to install: `nix/README.md` says where it goes.
