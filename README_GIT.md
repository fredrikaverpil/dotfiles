### Repository access

- Add the machine's `id_rsa.pub` or `id_ed25519.pub` SSH key to GitHub.
- Always clone down using SSH (not HTTPS).
- For the GitHub CLI, use `gh auth login` to authenticate.

### 1Password commit signing

Find the item in 1Password containing the git commit signing key info and save this as `~/.gitconfig_1password`. This file is included by `~/.gitconfig` of these dotfiles.

On WSL, replace the path to the CLI with `/mnt/c/ ...` in `~/.gitconfig_1password`.
