# Claude instructions

## Sage

If there's a `.sage/` folder in the project, this indicates the project uses
Makefiles to run commands for linting, testing, deploying etc. These Makefiles
are generated by the Go code inside the `./sage` folder.
[Sage](https://github.com/einride/sage) is an open source project.

## Pocket

If there's a `.pocket/` folder in the project, this indicates the project uses
`./pok` shims to run commands for linting, testing, deploying etc. These shims
are generated by [https://github.com/fredrikaverpil/pocket](Pocket) (an open
source project). Use `./pok -h` to list the tasks available.

## Git

When creating git commits, do NOT include "Co-Authored-By" or any other
attribution to Claude/AI in the commit message. Always use conventional commits
(with scope, when possible).

## GitHub

When I provide github.com links (PRs, issues, comments, actions, etc.), ALWAYS
use the `gh` CLI to fetch the content instead of WebFetch. WebFetch often fails
on GitHub pages. Useful commands:

- `gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/comments` - PR review comments
- `gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/reviews` - PR reviews
- `gh pr view NUMBER` - PR details
- `gh run view RUN_ID --log` - GitHub Actions logs

## Jira

If you come by a jira ticket number, use `jira-cli` to acquire more details.

## Go

- Use `go doc` when uncertain on how to use a package.
- If the package is not installed locally, search
  [https://pkg.go.dev](pkg.go.dev). Standard library functions are available
  (example: [`https://pkg.go.dev/fmt`](fmt package)).

## Npm and bun

- Always prefer `bun` (or `bunx`) over `npm` (or `npmx`), unless the project
  explicitly already uses Node/npm.
