If there's a `.sage/` folder in the project, this indicates the project uses
Makefiles to run commands for linting, testing, deploying etc. These Makefiles
are generated by the Go code inside the `./sage` folder.
[Sage](https://github.com/einride/sage) is an open source project.

## GitHub

When I provide github.com links (PRs, issues, comments, actions, etc.), ALWAYS
use the `gh` CLI to fetch the content instead of WebFetch. WebFetch often fails
on GitHub pages. Useful commands:

- `gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/comments` - PR review comments
- `gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/NUMBER/reviews` - PR reviews
- `gh pr view NUMBER` - PR details
- `gh run view RUN_ID --log` - GitHub Actions logs
