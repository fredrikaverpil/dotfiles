# This script is used to manage dependabot PRs and assumes you have merge queue enabled.
#
# Relevant GitHub docs
# - Interact with PR checks via REST API: https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/using-the-rest-api-to-interact-with-checks
# - Search by commit status: https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-commit-status
# NOTE: GitHub cannot search certain characters, see https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/402

# Features:
# - Auto-approve if CI checks passed.
# - Auto-queue (onto merge queue) if CI checks passed.
# - Filter on dev dependencies only, using `--dev` flag
#   NOTE: requires that PRs are labeled with "chore(dev-deps)". This can be achieved with dependabot config:
#
# ```yaml
# commit-message:
#   prefix: "chore"
#   include: "scope"
# ````
#

if [[ "$1" == "--dev" ]]; then
	# shift
	filter_dev="chore(dev-deps) in:title"
	echo "Filtering on dev dependencies only, using search term '$filter_dev'"
else
	filter_dev=""
fi

pending_prs=""
successful_prs=""
